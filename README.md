This is an example site built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app). It is a simple site that should be cloned and modified to suit your needs.

## Getting Started

You can run the app locally by running `yarn dev` or `npm run dev` in the root directory of the project.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
